            <h1>Programming</h1>
            <p class="storyText">There is nothing better than hashing out glitch after frustrating glitch... said no programmer ever. That said, for some reason, I keep coming back. I have been programming since around sixth grade, but in 7th when I first went to DDA and took Mr. Belch's programming class, that's when my interest really peaked. I started with some light HTML, and I would say I'm intermediate in 3 languages. HTML5 (Counting this as one, HTML, CSS, and front-end Javascript, back end boggles my mind), Python, and Swift</p>

            <h1>Quads</h1>
            <p class="storyText">I just recently fell in love with Mini Quads (Racing Drones). I have no flight experience with the bigger size mini quads, right now I have a Micro (qx95) and a Tiny Whoop, but from flying on a sim and watching hours of youtube videos it looks so amazing. I am currently saving up for a new controller and a quad of my own.</p>

            <h1>Longboarding</h1>
            <p class="storyText">I got my first longboard a couple of years ago. I started out cruising the streets of my neighborhood but quickly fell into the world of downhill longboarding. I've been to several races. Most of the races I've been to I didn't compete, just practiced on the course during breaks. This year I am hoping to compete for more. I am also hoping to get better at doing slides/drifts this year.</p>

            <h1>Photo/Video</h1>
            <p class="storyText">I have been in 4h photography for as long as I have been in 4h. I started on point and shoots, then I got my papaws DSLR. It was old but it did the job. Now I have a Canon t5i. I wanted to upgrade to the t5i because of the last camera didn't record video or have the live viewing. Besides 4h pictures, I use my camera for school videos, longboard events, and much more.</p>
